  <h1>XV Top 5 Games</h1>
  <p>These 5 games are the ones that were the most fun to play and enjoy. As a kid growing up and revisiting/now playing these games. <p>

<ol>
    <li>
      <h2>Legend Of Zelda: Breath of The Wild</h2>
      <div class="games"><img src="images/game_img/BOTW.jpeg" alt="BotW"></div>
    <p>This ranks up to the very top being an industry changing game, using the nintendo switch in a few ways to enhance the player experience. The story is very stable and provides an honest journey to enjoy with or without help. Overal 10/10 having great qualities that envelop the best parts of gaming all in one. </p></li>
  
    <li>
      <h2>Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep</h2>
     <div class="games"><img src="images/game_img/BBS.png" alt="BBS"></div>
    <p>Previously only available for PSP, now on every platform today ranking high with story and nostalgia using Disney and Final Fantasy-esque characters to build their stories makes this a truly remarkable game. </p></li>

   <li>
      <h2>Bioshock 1</h2>
     <div class="games"><img src="images/game_img/Bioshock.jpeg" alt="Bishock"></div>
    <p>A true classic from Xbox 360 age, the eerie story, the combat and points system all make up integral parts that make this a masterpiece.  </p></li>

 <li>
      <h2>Batman: Arkham City</h2>
     <div class="games"><img src="images/game_img/Arkham.jpeg" alt="Arkham City"></div>
    <p>This game has excerptional combat, puzzles and story. Definitely up there due to the DLC though.</p></li>

 <li>
      <h2>Persona 5 Royal</h2>
     <div class="games1"><img src="images/game_img/P5R.jpeg" alt="P5R"></div>
    <p>The constant use of the life simulation mixed with the action, adventure and the storytelling Atlus is well known for makes this a great game. </p></li>
